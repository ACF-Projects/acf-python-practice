# PASSWORD STRENGTH

"""
Here, your task is to write some code that
runs through a list of passwords, report to the
user how "strong" they are, and then fix them 
to turn them into good passwords.

If there are any questions about this
assignment, feel free to ask questions!
"""

# Below is a list of strings called "passwords".
# Every string represents somebody's password.
# You do NOT need to modify this list.
passwords = ["hi", 
             "ACF15COOL#000?",
             "123",
             "rubber__ducky",
             "P4SSW0RD",
             "pie-thon1",
             "bye",
             "apple"]

# PART 1: For every password in the list, print 
# a message in the following format:
# (password) is (weak/normal/strong)
# If a password is 0-6 chars long, it is WEAK.
# If a password is 7-10 chars long, it is NORMAL.
# If a password is 11+ chars long, it is STRONG.



# PART 2: For every password in the list, while 
# a password is WEAK (0-6 characters long), add 
# "0"s to the end of it until it has 7 characters.
# Ex: "hi" should become "hi00000"
# Ex: "pie-thon1" should remain "pie-thon1"
# Then, print out the list.
