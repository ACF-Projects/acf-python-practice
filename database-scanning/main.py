# DATABASE SCANNING

# The following includes our database list. 
# You do NOT need to modify it in any way 
# for this exercise.
# It contains lists inside of it, each of 
# which follow the same syntax:
# [ name, title, salary ]
database = [["Kevin", "CEO", 137500],
           ["Tracy", "Secretary", 78000],
           ["Bob", "Worker", 32000],
           ["Pete", "Worker", 27500],
           ["Gavin", "Worker", 26000],
           ["Mildew", "Worker", 31000],
           ["Lucas", "Worker", 23500],
           ["Ashley", "Worker", 46000],
           ["Eric", "Worker", 32000],
           ["Ariel", "Worker", 39000],
           ["Chris", "Worker", 26000],
           ["Catherine", "Worker", 31000],
           ["Jacy", "Worker", 23500]]

# PART 1: Print the information of every 
# employee in the database on separate lines. 
# (Do not print the database list, but print 
# every list inside.)


  
# PART 2: Print out the NAME of every worker 
# that has a salary under $30,000.
# (The expected output should be Pete, Gavin, 
# Lucas, Chris, and Lucy.)



# PART 3: If any employee that is a WORKER in 
# the database has a salary over $30,000, change 
# their title from WORKER to OFFICER. Print the 
# list to make sure your changes are correct.
# (Bob, Mildew, Ashley, Eric, Ariel, and 
# Catherine should now appear as "Officer".)
