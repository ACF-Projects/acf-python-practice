# ACF Practice Assignments (Python)
This folder contains a variety of other folders, each representing an assignment. 
This list is not exhaustive and is vaguely sorted on difficulty. 
Assignments further down typically require more Python background to complete. 

## How To Use
Every folder represents a single assignment, with comments inside of every file
introducing the problem statement and required code. To work with the code:
1. download/clone this repository
2. choose an assignment you'd like to complete (see the list below)
3. find its respective folder and its `main.py` file (and other files in the folder if provided)
4. ensure Python is installed on your computer and start coding!<br/>

_Alternatively, you may also copy the code of a file and paste it into an environment that can run Python like [the Replit website](https://replit.com/~)._

## Folder Structure
Every subfolder contains files for the TEMPLATED Python assignment. This can be
given to a student to complete. Each subfolder also contains a separate `complete`
folder, which houses a potential solution to the problem with completed code.
