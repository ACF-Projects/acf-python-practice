# ACF Practice Assignments (Python)
This folder contains a variety of other folders, each representing an assignment. 
This list is not exhaustive and is vaguely sorted on difficulty. 
Assignments further down typically require more Python background to complete. 

## Folder Structure
Every subfolder contains files for the TEMPLATED Python assignment. This can be
given to a student to complete. Each subfolder also contains a separate `complete`
folder, which houses a potential solution to the problem with completed code.
