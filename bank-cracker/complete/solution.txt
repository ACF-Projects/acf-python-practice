131140155.5

Rationale:
-----------------------------------------------------------
KEY ONE is 131 because input_one is treated as a STRING.
input_one + "3" == "1313" thus requires input_one to be "131",
as it is concatenated with "3".

KEY TWO is 140 because input_one is converted into an INTEGER.
We are comparing this integer 131, added to 9, equaling 140,
to the INTEGER value of input_two. This requires input_two to be
"140".

KEY THREE is 155.5 because the first conditional restricts the
value of input_three to be rounded down to 155. This is the natural
behavior of the INTEGER typecast. We always cut off what is after a
decimal point. Then, we are comparing input_three (a FLOAT) to see if
it is equivalent to its rounded down version after subtracting 0.5.
This means it has to be 0.5 above its integer representation. This
requires input_three to be 155.5, with any amount of zeroes afterwards
being allowed.
